     What follows is a suggested procedure for reporting PyTalker bugs. You
aren't obliged to use the bug reporting format, it is provided as a guide
to the kind of information that can be useful to developers - no more.

     If the failure includes a Python Traceback type message in your log or on
screen please post it on your bug report. 

     Please include in your report which Operating System are you using, which
version of it, and the output of python -v.

	Send the bug report to the maintainer of the area that seems to be 
involved with the problem. Don't worry too much about getting the wrong person.
If you are unsure send it to the person responsible for the code relevant to
what you were doing. If it occurs repeatably try and describe how to recreate
it. That is worth even more than the traceback itself.

The list of maintainers is in the MAINTAINERS file in this directory.

      This is a suggested format for a bug report sent to PyTalker maintainers.
Having a standardized bug report form makes it easier for you not to overlook
things, and easier for the developers to find the pieces of information they're
really interested in. Don't feel you have to follow it.

      Fill in all fields of the bug report form, and post it to the maintainer
a subject of "PyTalker PROBLEM: <one line summary from [1.]>" for easy
identification by the maintainer   

[1.] One line summary of the problem
[2.] Full description of the problem/report
[3.] python -v output
[4.] Operating System version
[5.] Python traceback (if applicable)
[6.] A small shell script or example program which triggers the problem (if
     possible)
[X.] Other notes, patches, fixes, workarounds


Thank you
