This is the roadmap for the development of PyTalker.
This file is extremely outdated. An updated version is on our develepment
setup, feel free to ask privileges to see it.

Versioning:
PyTalker uses a triplet of numbers for it's versioning. In a version vZ.Y.X, it
means:

    * Z - Major version
    * Y - Middle version
    * X - Minor version

Z will show a full funcionality version of PyTalker;
Y indicates a step further in Z version of PyTalker;
X indicates minor changes: bug/security fixes and stuff like that.

RoadMap:
For now PyTalker is on it's version v0.Y.X. This roadmap indicates what we
pretend to do until v1.0.0 is reached.

v0.3.X

In this version we intend to implement simple talker functions...

	v0.2.0 - ranks
	v0.2.1 - rooms
	v0.2.2 - prompt
	v0.2.3 - command abbreviation
	v0.2.4 - usename abbreviation
	v0.2.5 - .review

v0.4.X

The grand concept behind this version is the implementation of the
talker base as a 3-tier system. This will imply a division of PyTalker in 3
(inicially) projects: PyTalker (the talker base itself), The Talker Protocol (a
definition of a protocol to get a standard used in Talkers, and that will
define the messages swapped between the 1st and 2nd tiers) and TelTalker (a
Telnet interface for talkers).

v0.5.X

Mamnuts-like functionalities.

v0.6.X

EUTS-like functionalities.

v0.7.X

I/O choice: files or database.

v0.8.X

Configuration tools: text-based; ncurses; gui; web-based.

v1.0.0

All requisits (*) must be fulfilled for this version to come out.
