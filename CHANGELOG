v0.3.0
   New version from 0.1.12. Abandoned the 0.2 series.
   - Save room every time it changes room. (This may sound unefficient for
     userdata files, but it becomes more efficient if you use a database. And
     that is planned to be used.)
   - Go to main room if the loaded room does not exist.
   - Userdata file. Contains user data, field indexed.
   - Save details on exit.
   - Command completion.
   - .rank command. This command promotes and demotes users.
   - .user command. Show user details and lists all talker users.
   - Minor string bugfixes.

v0.1.12
   This is a bugfix-only release, and we hope it is the last on the 0.1 series.
   - Changed the clear screen function to be the same used by the talker
	 itself, and in every part we want to use it, like in .cls or .password
	 (that now clears the screen). It's output also changed in order to send
	 more new lines than previously.
   - Fixed a bug in .help for the english version that crashed user actions, so
	 upgrading is highly recommended.

v0.1.11
   This aims to be the last version on the 0.1 series. Further versions will
   only contain bug or security fixes. The changes were:
   - Rules are only shown if this is register time to the user
   - .cls
   - after inserting the password, the user gets his screen cleaned
   - .news

v0.1.10
   - .emote
   - .pemote
   - .suicide
   - two bugfix'es in .help that would only affect you if you tried to use
	 another commands directory besides "commands"
   - new directory "commands-pt" with the same commands but in Portuguese. If
	 you want to help with other translations, feel free to contact me! 

v0.1.9 
   - Session Takeover

v0.1.8
   - .password command, so users can change their password
   - For easyness of migration from PyTalker 0.1.7 to 0.1.8, the "standard"
	 users directory is no longer "users" but "userfiles". If you want to
	 migrate your users, just edit your actual "users" username.py files, copy
	 the content of the password variable there, and write it to the
	 userfiles/username : only the password hash and anything else. Yes, this
	 also means that you're not supposed to have any \n or stuff like that.

v0.1.6
   - Sanatization of the login system.

     without any text. This bug was generated by the correction of the 0.1.3
     bug.
